# SFML-Simple-Space-Game
### Hi stranger!
What you can find here is my first game in C++\
using SFML.\
I hope you like it, i know it isn't perfect but i tried my best.\
xoxo Kapiura\
If u want to play, u need to install SFML and C++ compilator, I was using g++ in terminal.\
\
Installing SFML using apt\
***
sudo apt install libsfml-dev
sudo apt install g++
***
\
To run game, you need to get into directory "Source"\
Then write in your terminal command:
***
g++ -o main main.cpp -lsfml-system -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window && ./main
***
\
In the future I would like to make executable file, but idk when (no, i wont)
